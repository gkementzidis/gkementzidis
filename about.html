      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I was born in Thessaloniki, Greece. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics at Grinnell College, in Iowa. I am grateful for completing
        my undegraduate studies at one of the most prestigious liberal arts colleges in the country. The flexible curriculum gave me the opportunity to take courses
        from various departments like German Literature, Economics, and Film Studies. My participation in summer programs and research experiences (REU) in the 
        areas of Mathematical Physics and Fractal Analysis, as well as my experience with Computational Physics and Applied Math helped me develop a passion for
        Computational Applied Mathematics.</p>
     <p>Then, I moved to Stony Brook University to pursue a doctoral degree in Applied Mathematics. My supervisor is Professor Yuefan Deng. I am currently working
     on problems associated with methods used to accelearate molecular dynamics simulations. The use of Machine Learning is a core part of my research.</p>
