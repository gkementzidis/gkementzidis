      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I was born in Thessaloniki, Greece. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics at Grinnell College, in Iowa. I am grateful for completing
        my undegraduate studies at a prestigious liberal arts college. The flexible curriculum gave me the opportunity to take courses from various departments
         like German Literature, Economics, and Film Studies.</p>
      <p>My participation in summer research programs in the areas of Mathematical Physics and Fractal Analysis, as well as my experience 
         with Computational Physics helped me develop a passion for Computational Applied Mathematics.</p>
      <p>I moved to Stony Brook University to pursue a doctoral degree. My supervisor is Professor Yuefan Deng. I am using Machine Learning to answer 
      questions associated with biomedical sciences.</p>
